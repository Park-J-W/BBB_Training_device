	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

if RTC_CLASS

config RTC_DRV_AS3722
	tristate "ams AS3722 RTC driver"
	depends on MFD_AS3722
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the RTC of ams AS3722 PMIC
	  chips.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-as3722.

config RTC_DRV_DS1307
	tristate "Dallas/Maxim DS1307/37/38/39/40, ST M41T00, EPSON RX-8025"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for various compatible RTC
	  chips (often with battery backup) connected with I2C. This driver
	  should handle DS1307, DS1337, DS1338, DS1339, DS1340, ST M41T00,
	  EPSON RX-8025 and probably other chips. In some cases the RTC
	  must already have been initialized (by manufacturing or a
	  bootloader).

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms. NVRAM is visible in
	  sysfs, but other chip features may not be available.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-ds1307.

config RTC_DRV_DS1374
	tristate "Dallas/Maxim DS1374"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for Dallas Semiconductor
	  DS1374 real-time clock chips. If an interrupt is associated
	  with the device, the alarm functionality is supported.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-ds1374.
